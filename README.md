# shopping-behavior
 As a junior data analyst at FlashFash, a rapidly expanding online shopping company based in Bengaluru, India, my assignement involves delving into the shopping behavior of American consumers. The primary goal is to gain insights into the American market by analyzing a sample dataset. My responsibilities include deriving aggregate descriptive statistics, creating visualizations, and examining patterns in American consumers' behavior. Specifically, the focus is on uncovering seasonal shopping trends, identifying demographics that make the most purchases, and formulating effective market outreach strategies to optimize sales.

## Observations 
In our analysis of purchasing trends across the United States, it was evident that California led with the highest number of transactions, while Hawaii recorded the lowest. Interestingly, winter emerged as the season associated with the most substantial volume of purchases. When it comes to payment methods, credit cards proved to be the overwhelmingly preferred choice among our customers in the US. However, the least popular form of payment is yet to be determined. In terms of shipping preferences, standard shipping emerged as the prevailing choice for our US-based customers. Examining the distribution of ages in our dataset, a right-skewed pattern is evident in the 'Age' column, indicating that individuals between 18 and 60 years old made the majority of purchases. On the other hand, the 'Purchase Amount (USD)' column displayed a normal distribution, showcasing a symmetrical arrangement of data points without any noticeable skew.
During the fall season, the top three colors preferred by shoppers are Brown, Burnt Orange, and Terra Cotta, while winter sees a preference for Black, Burnt Orange, and Aubergine. Spring brings a shift towards lighter hues with Baby Blue, White, and Lavender as the top three colors, while summer trends towards Lavender, Lemon Yellow, and Baby Blue. Correspondingly, the popular clothing items vary by season, featuring Backpacks in fall, Running Shoes in spring, Shorts in summer, and Leggings in winter. As part of my analysis, I hypothesize that there is no significant difference in spending behavior between shoppers who utilized the promo code and those who did not. Consequently, we anticipate rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no distinction between what shoppers who used the promo code spent and users who did not use the promo code. From a human perspective, the group with higher spending might be more inclined to leave reviews, possibly reflecting a higher satisfaction level or a stronger motivation to share their experiences, as evidenced by fewer missing reviews compared to the lower spending group. Conversely, the lower spending group may have provided lower scores, indicative of potentially lower satisfaction or a propensity not to express their sentiments openly.
